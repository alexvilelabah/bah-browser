# Architecture & repository map

**English** · [Português](ARCHITECTURE.pt-BR.md)

A guide for reading the codebase. Pair it with [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (threat model +
audit checklist). The whole of `src/` is ~30 files — small enough to read in a sitting.

Bah is an Electron app with two processes joined by a preload bridge. Web pages load inside
a `<webview partition="persist:browser">`. The agent **observes** a page, **decides** one
action, and **performs** it with **real OS input events** (not synthetic DOM events), so
sites behave exactly as they would for a human.

---

## The two processes + the bridge

- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — the React UI **and the agent's decision loop**. Runs
  sandboxed (`contextIsolation`, no `nodeIntegration`); it can only reach the OS through the
  preload bridge.
- **Main** (`src/main/`) — privileged (Node): windows, the `<webview>` session, real input
  injection, downloads, AI HTTP calls, ffmpeg/yt-dlp, OCR.
- **Preload** (`src/preload/preload.ts`) — the **only** bridge between them. One short file,
  a fixed list of IPC channels. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Live path of one command (the hot path)

1. You type in the box → [`AgentCommandBar.tsx`](src/renderer/components/AgentCommandBar.tsx)
   (`routeCommand`) decides: **deterministic quick action**, **AI-classify**, or **chat**.
2. An agent task calls `onExecute` ([`App.tsx`](src/renderer/App.tsx), ~line 862) → the
   ReAct loop. **The live agent loop lives in `App.tsx`.**
3. Each step resolves ONE action from either
   [`detectQuickAction`](src/renderer/site-knowledge.ts) (0-token shortcuts, no AI) **or**
   the AI ([`ai-engine.ts`](src/main/ai-engine.ts)).
4. The action runs: real click/type/key go renderer → preload → `main.ts`
   (`sendInputEvent`); in-page operations go through
   [`page-executor.ts`](src/renderer/page-executor.ts).
5. Before executing, the **safety brake** ([`risk.ts`](src/renderer/risk.ts)) gates
   pay / buy / delete / card-data actions and asks you to confirm.

> Deterministic-first is the design philosophy: common requests (open a video, download,
> generate an image, compare prices, news) are handled in `detectQuickAction` with **zero
> AI tokens**; the model is only called when real reasoning is needed.

## `src/main/` — privileged process

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.ts` | App bootstrap, window, `<webview>` session, **all IPC handlers**, real input (`sendInputEvent`), adblock, downloads wiring, safe-browsing, hardware-accel toggle |
| `ai-engine.ts` | Every cloud/local AI call (DeepSeek / Mistral / NVIDIA NIM / Pollinations / Ollama) + the system prompt and tool list |
| `site-locale.ts` | **Single source** for the language sites receive (Accept-Language / navigator.languages / --lang follow the UI choice) |
| `page-agent.ts` | Cloud-side reasoning helpers for the agent |
| `download-manager.ts` | Native download manager: pause/resume/cancel/queue/ETA, guarded `open-file` |
| `media-downloader.ts` | `yt-dlp` / `ffmpeg` wrapper (video/audio download) |
| `supercut.ts`, `video-cuts.ts`, `video-editor.ts`, `transcript.ts` | Local video features (cut highlights, trim, remove silence, extract audio, transcripts) — native ffmpeg |
| `image-harvester.ts` | Bulk image download + AI image generation (Pollinations), with limits |
| `ocr-engine.ts`, `page-capture.ts` | On-device OCR (Tesseract) + screenshots |
| `data-view.ts` | Renders data tables/charts to a local page (no CDN) |
| `validate.ts` | Path-safety helpers (`isInsideAllowedRoot`, etc.) |
| `popup-shield.ts`, `overlay-script.ts` | Popup/overlay handling and dismissal |
| `job-queue.ts` | Serialises long-running jobs |

---

## `src/renderer/` — UI + agent loop

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `App.tsx` | Top-level app; **the live agent ReAct loop** (`onExecute`) |
| `components/AgentCommandBar.tsx` | The unified command box, the activity feed, and settings |
| `components/` | `AddressBar`, `TabBar`, `WebViewContainer`, `AgentVisualOverlay` |
| `site-knowledge.ts` | Deterministic 0-token quick actions (`detectQuickAction`) |
| `page-executor.ts` | Executes browser actions inside the page |
| `risk.ts` | The safety-brake classifier (`riskForAction`) |
| `agent-recovery.ts`, `agent-login-policy.ts` | Stuck-state recovery + login/captcha detection |
| `agent-run-logger.ts` | Opt-in run logging (local training-data collector) |
| `store.ts` | UI/settings state (localStorage) |
| `i18n.ts` | Hand-rolled en / pt / es; **English is the default** |
| `macros.ts` | Record/replay of deterministic macros |

---

## Build & release

- **Build:** Renderer = Vite + `tsc` typecheck; Main = `tsc`. An i18n parity gate
  (`scripts/i18n-check.mjs`) **fails the build** if en/pt/es drift out of sync.
- **Package:** electron-builder (NSIS installer). [`build/afterPack.js`](build/afterPack.js)
  flips a conservative set of Electron Fuses on the binary.
- **Auto-update:** electron-updater pulls GitHub releases on launch (the installed app
  pulls; nothing is pushed to it).

## Removed / vestigial

- `AISidebar.tsx` and `VideoEditorPanel.tsx` were removed (they were not imported). The live
  assistant UI is `AgentCommandBar`. The video editor runs through the agent/IPC, not a panel.
